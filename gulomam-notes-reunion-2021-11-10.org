* Unify in single repository
- Solve main or dev in Ramon's repo
  - Ramon-TODO
- Merge with Pablo's shiny-dev
- Push shiny-dev to Ramon's
* Technical issues to figure out and solve: Ramon does a lot of this: Ramon-TODO
** The three figures we have
- "Probabilities": like flow
- Transition rate matrix
- Transition matrix between genotypes (probs add to 1 conditional on genotype)
** OT:
- what figures we want/we can use of the above three
- sample using the OT code and this is what goes in the table
** HyperTraPS
- They give "flow"
- From that, we can get transition matrix between genotypes
- How do we obtain the transition rate?
  - Check email exchange
* Miscell to add 
** Advanced settings
- MCCBN
- HyperTraPS
- Number of samples
- All of the above behind an "advanced"
** Check speed: anything to optimize for Draco (at end)
** Tab with list of examples
- Clicking takes to input
** Help when hovering over options
- For the three types of figures
- For the examples
** Gene names: could they be arbitrary?
** Show DAG for some of the examples/Show MHN for some of the exmaples
** DAG builder
- OT
- CBN
- MHN
