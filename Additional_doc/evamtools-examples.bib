  abstract =      {To characterize somatic alterations in colorectal
                   carcinoma, we conducted a genome-scale analysis of
                   276 samples, analysing exome sequence, DNA copy
                   number, promoter methylation and messenger RNA and
                   microRNA expression. A subset of these samples (97)
                   underwent low-depth-of-coverage whole-genome
                   sequencing. In total, 16\% of colorectal carcinomas
                   were found to be hypermutated: three-quarters of
                   these had the expected high microsatellite
                   instability, usually with hypermethylation and MLH1
                   silencing, and one-quarter had somatic
                   mismatch-repair gene and polymerase {$\epsilon$}
                   (POLE) mutations. Excluding the hypermutated cancers,
                   colon and rectum cancers were found to have
                   considerably similar patterns of genomic alteration.
                   Twenty-four genes were significantly mutated, and in
                   addition to the expected APC, TP53, SMAD4, PIK3CA and
                   KRAS mutations, we found frequent mutations in
                   ARID1A, SOX9 and FAM123B. Recurrent copy-number
                   alterations include potentially drug-targetable
                   amplifications of ERBB2 and newly discovered
                   amplification of IGF2. Recurrent chromosomal
                   translocations include the fusion of NAV2 and WNT
                   pathway member TCF7L1. Integrative analyses suggest
                   new markers for aggressive colorectal carcinoma and
                   an important role for MYC-directed transcriptional
                   activation and repression.},

                   Using Cancer Progression Models},

  abstract =      {Successful prediction of the likely paths of tumor
                   progression is valuable for diagnostic, prognostic,
                   and treatment purposes. Cancer progression models
                   (CPMs) use cross-sectional samples to identify
                   restrictions in the order of accumulation of driver
                   mutations and thus CPMs encode the paths of tumor
                   progression. Here we analyze the performance of four
                   CPMs to examine whether they can be used to predict
                   the true distribution of paths of tumor progression
                   and to estimate evolutionary unpredictability.
                   Employing simulations we show that if fitness
                   landscapes are single peaked (have a single fitness
                   maximum) there is good agreement between true and
                   predicted distributions of paths of tumor progression
                   when sample sizes are large, but performance is poor
                   with the currently common much smaller sample sizes.
                   Under multi-peaked fitness landscapes (i.e., those
                   with multiple fitness maxima), performance is poor
                   and improves only slightly with sample size. In all
                   cases, detection regime (when tumors are sampled) is
                   a key determinant of performance. Estimates of
                   evolutionary unpredictability from the best
                   performing CPM, among the four examined, tend to
                   overestimate the true unpredictability and the bias
                   is affected by detection regime; CPMs could be useful
                   for estimating upper bounds to the true evolutionary
                   unpredictability. Analysis of twenty-two cancer data
                   sets shows low evolutionary unpredictability for
                   several of the data sets. But most of the predictions
                   of paths of tumor progression are very unreliable,
                   and unreliability increases with the number of
                   features analyzed. Our results indicate that CPMs
                   could be valuable tools for predicting cancer
                   progression but that, currently, obtaining useful
                   predictions of paths of tumor progression from CPMs
                   is dubious, and emphasize the need for methodological
                   work that can account for the probably multi-peaked
                   fitness landscapes in cancer.},
