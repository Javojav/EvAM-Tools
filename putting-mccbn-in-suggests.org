* Why
- See my latest comment on the bug report in https://github.com/cbg-ethz/MC-CBN/issues/5#issuecomment-1340660538
- Original report was on April 2021 (over 18 months ago)
- Unless this is fixed, MCCBN will become non-installable
* Suggests
- Yes, here. See http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/blog/2017/03/22/#suggests_is_not_depends
- Well, not quite:
  - https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-devel/2016-April/072531.html
  - I do not want to use _R_CHECK_FORCE_SUGGESTS_
- So it is now in Enhances
* TODO
- mccbn::random_poset is used in several places. Must copy the function (adding authors to code) so we do not depend on MCCBN
