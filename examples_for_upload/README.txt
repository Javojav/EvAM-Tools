Three example data sets for upload. ovx and ov are from the Oncotree package[1] , using either the original names of genes or a transformation (both work, though, even if for safety we say no gene names should start with a number).

The second is a tiny data to easily do things such as make a whole gene of 0 presence by removing a genotype, etc.
