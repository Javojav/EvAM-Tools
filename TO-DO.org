* Try to decreased depended upon packages
- shiny and shinyjs only needed for shiny app, so enhances/suggests, not importFrom
- remove all uses of stringr and replace by stringi, which we are already using
* In call to evam in server.R (around line 2383), do not use only_used_methods = FALSE
- I added it for now, in case it was used and to prevent mysterious failures. Remove if we can.
