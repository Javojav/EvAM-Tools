These two subdirectories test that our code for sampling from the transition rate matrices work. We compare the samples we generate from our code with the samples generated by the original authors of MHN and MCCBN.

The main idea is generating samples, and comparing the frequencies of the genotypes. We do that a large number of times, for different sample sizes and different number of genes.  For each scenario, we compare with a chi-square test the distributions of genotypes and store the p-value. Finally, we examine the distribution of the p-values of these chi-square tests: under the null, they should be distributed as a uniform(0, 1) (actually, not exactly from 0, since  the chi-square p-values are obtained via permutation (B = 2000, 4000, 10000, depending on the cases) ---see function my_chi_unif). The number of p-values examined in each scenario was of 10000. The number of samples drawn for each comparison (i.e., to obtain a single p-value from a chi-square) was 50000 or 100000.
