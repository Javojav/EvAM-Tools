- To modify the overview figures, use the SVG file (figure-overview.svg for before version with BML and HyperTraPS, figure-overview-2.svg for version post additions of BML and HyperTraPS).

- The colored paths are part of the SVG. In Inkscape, they are another layer (that you can hide or show on demand). The layer is called "Paths" in figure-overview-2.svg (and Layer 2 in figure-overview.svg).

- From the SVG I generated the PDF and PNG files.
